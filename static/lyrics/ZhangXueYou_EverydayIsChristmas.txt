Everyday
is
like
Christmas
day
With
you
in
my
arms
Getting
cozy
in
Santa's
sleigh
You
to
keep
me
warm
Underneath
that
big
green
tree
The
stars
shine
down
It's
so
heavenly
oh
Everyday
is
Like
Christmas
day
When
you're
with
me
Everyday
song
is
Christmas
song
Hear
the
angels
sing
And
when
you
kiss
me
I
sing
along
Just
hear
the
bells
ring
In
the
spirit
of
good
cheer
They
chime
so
magically
All
can
hear
that
Everyday
song
is
a
Christmas
song
With
you
my
dear
*
Everyday
is
Christmas
Everyday
is
Christmas
I
may
be
naive
But
I
do
believe
That
reindeer
fly
on
Christmas
Eve
Cause
Santa
he
Brought
you
here
to
me
*

Everywhere
that
we
look
around
It's
startin'
to
snow
And
when
you
hold
me
with
you
I've
found
All
I
need
to
know
Hiding
in
this
spot'bow
the
chimneytops
Watchin'Santa
Claus
make
his
stops
oh
We're
so
happy
with
what
we're
got
Let's
let
it
rock
*
Everyday
