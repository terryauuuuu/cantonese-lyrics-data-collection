there's
no
Heaven
It's
easy
if
you
try
No
hell
below
us
Above
us
only
sky
Imagine
all
the
people
Living
for
today
Imagine
there's
no
countries
It
isn't
hard
to
do
Nothing
to
kill
or
die
for
And
no
religion
too
Imagine
all
the
people
Living
life
in
peace
You
may
say
that
I'm
a
dreamer
But
I'm
not
the
only
one

I
hope
someday
you'll
join
us
And
the
world
will
be
as
one
oh
oh
You
may
say
that
I'm
a
dreamer
But
I'm
not
the
only
one
I
hope
someday
you'll
join
us
And
the
world
will
live
as
one
live
as
one
as
one
live
as
one
You
may
say
that
I'm
a
dreamer
But
I'm
not
the
only
one
I
hope
someday
you'll
join
us
And
the
world
will
be
as
..
