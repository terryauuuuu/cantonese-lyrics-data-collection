I
can
feel
the
night
upon
my
skin
and
I
can't
sleep
You
know
I
want
you,
you
know
I
want
you
I
can
feel
the
fire,
my
desire
burns
so
deep
I
need
to
love
you,to
feel
you
want
me
too
And
I
never
knew
I
could
love
you
this
way
And
I
want
you
more
than
I
ever
could
say
Don't
make
me
wait,
baby
do
it
again
Over
and
over
again
(Chorus)
Your
lips,
speak
without,
speak
without
words
I
can
feel
you
deep
inside
of
me
Feel
my
body
sweetly
lose
control
Speak
without,
speak
without
words
When
we
kiss
I
feel
the
mystery
Touch
my
body
and
my
soul
In
the
velvet
silence
I
reach
out
to
touch
your
skin
And
there
is
magic,
in
every
part
of
me

When
I
hear
your
voice
inside
my
head
and
I
begin
To
understand
your
secret
poetry
And
I
never
knew
I
could
love
you
this
way
And
I
want
you
more
than
I
ever
could
say
Please
baby,
please
baby,
do
it
again
Over
and
over
again
(Chorus)
Your
lips,
speak
without,
speak
without
words
etc.
And
I
nevr
knew
that
your
love
was
so
strong
And
I
never
knew
it
could
last
so
long
I'm
gonna
do
everything
that
you
want
Tonight,
oh
baby,just
reach
out
(Spanish
chorus)
Tus
Labios,
habian
En
to
poder
mi
entrego
a
la
passion
Haslan
sin,Hablan
sin
decir
Tu
me
resas
y
te
biento
aqui
En
fundo
do
mi
corazon
