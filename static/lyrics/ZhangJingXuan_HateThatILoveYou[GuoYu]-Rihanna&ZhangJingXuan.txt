R：
So
how
much
I
love
you
(H：Yeah)

So
how
much
I
need
you
(H：Yeah
Yeah
Yeah)
R：And
I
can't
stand
ya

Must
everything
you
do

Make
me
wanna
smile

Can
I
not
like
it
for
awhile
No
H：我也失望

相處那麼長
相好那麼短

總是在親吻中善忘
討厭那快感

把錯誤都給遺忘

But
I
hate
it
R：You
know
exactly
what
to
do

So
that
I
can't
stay
mad
at
you

For
too
long

That's
wrong
H：Girl
I
hate
it

你的指尖擦過臉龐

就忘了爭吵的損傷
就像矛盾

都與我們的未來無關
R：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
boy

I
can't
stand
how
much
I
need
you
(H:
I
need
you)
R：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
boy

But
I
just
can't
let
you
go

And
I
hate
that
I
love
you
so
H：你明白你擅長
把弄我的遐想

從苦痛變換成狂歡

R：Sad
and
it's
not
fair

How
you
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that

I
love
you
beyond
the
reason
why

And
it
just
ain't
right
H：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
girl

恨自己一邊愛一邊忍受

And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
girl

愛恨都是種挑逗

But
I
hate
that
I
love
you
so
R：One
of
these
days
maybe
your
magic
won't
affect
me

And
your
kiss
won't
make
me
weak
H：我的思想
都被困在

你能透視的目光

美麗的咒語
已種在我身上

Hate
that
I
love
you
so
R：So
much
I
love
you
H：How
much
I
need
you
R：So
much
I
need
you
H：How
much
I
love
you
R：So
much
I
love
you
(H:
I
need
you)

So
much
I
need
you
(H:
I
need
you)
R：And
I
hate
that
I
love
you
(R+H:
So)
H：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
girl
(R:
Hey)
R：I
can't
stand
how
much
I
need
you
(H:
I
can't
stand
how
much
I
need
you)
R：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
boy
(H:
Yeah
Oh)

But
I
just
can't
let
you
go
(H:
But
I
just
can't
let
go
No)
R+H：And
I
hate
that
I
love
you
so


And
I
hate
that
I
love
you
so
so
