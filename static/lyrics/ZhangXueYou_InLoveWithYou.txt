Just
a
gentle
whisper,
told
me
that
you'd
gone
Leaving
only
memories,
where
did
we
go
wrong?
I
couldn't
find
the
words
then,
so
let
me
say
them
now
I'm
still
in
love
with
you
Tell
me
that
you
love
me,
tell
me
that
you
care
Tell
me
that
you
need
me,
and
I'll
be
there
I'll
be
there
waiting
I
will
always
love
you,
I
will
always
stay
true
There's
no
one
who
loves
you
like
I
do
Come
to
me
now
I
will
never
leave
you,
I
will
stay
here
with
you
Through
the
good
and
bad
I
will
stand
true
I'm
in
love
with
you
Now
we're
here
together,
yesterday
has
past
Life
is
just
beginning,
close
to
you
at
last
And
I
promise
to
you,
I
will
always
be
there

I
give
my
all
to
you
Living
life
without
you
is
more
than
I
can
bear
Hold
me
close
forever,
I'll
be
there....
I'll
be
there
for
you
I
will
always
love
you,
I
will
always
stay
true
There's
no
one
who
loves
you
like
I
do
This
I
promise...
I
will
never
leave
you,
I
will
stay
here
with
you
Through
the
good
and
bad
I
will
stand
true
Hold
me
closer...
Our
love
is
forever,
holding
us
together
Nothing
in
this
world
can
stop
us
now
Love
has
found,
love
has
found
a
way
I'm
in
love
(I
so
in
love)
I'm
in
love
Yes
(I'm
in
love)
I
so
in
love
with
you
