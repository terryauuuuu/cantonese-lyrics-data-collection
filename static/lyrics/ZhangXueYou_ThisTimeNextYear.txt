Tonight
you
say,that
I'm
your
only
one,
You
caress
me
tender,Until
the
morning
comes,
The
sound
of
your
whisper,Ringin'
inside
my
ear,
I
want
to
hear
those
same
sweet
words
next
year
ooh~~~
Change:So
many
lovers,
other
lovers
came
and
gone
Makin'
promises
forever
only
till
the
next
one
comes
along
(Chorus)
So
why
don't
you
tell
me,This
time
next
year,
Will
you
still
love
me
true,Or
will
I
be
losing
you,

Why
don't
tell
me,This
time
next
year,
After
all
the
ups
and
downs,Are
you
gonna
be
around,
Don't
ever
leave
me,Don't
ever
go
away,
Just
tell
me
I
got
nothin'
to
fear,
Baby
this
time
next
year.
I
love
you
so
with
all
of
my
heart
and
soul,
Don't
wanna
lose
you,Don't
want
this
love
so
grow
old,
Not
much
am
I
askin',All
I
want
is
you,
I
feel
you
inside
my
heart,
With
every
little
thing
you
do.
