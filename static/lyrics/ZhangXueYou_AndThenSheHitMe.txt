I
came
to
life
and
threw
my
pants
on
and
I
searched
for
shoes
to
fit
the
groove
to
get
my
dance
on
to
Take
a
ride
into
down
town
on
main
street
where
A
friend
of
mine
was
playing
live
down
at
RBC's
But
girl
friend
is
talking
so
long
Hogging
the
bathroom
and
the
phone
Then
she
had
the
nerve
to
say
the
words
that
I
should
click
and
go
And
don't
change
mood
with
attitude
and
I
said...you
should
talk
Right
then
I
knew
I
blew
it
Right
then
I
stepped
into
it
I
knew
that
I
would
need
a
drink
to
get
through
it
She
just
turned
around
and
smiled....
And
then
she
hit
me
And
then
she
hit
me
We
walked
in
at
half
past
ten
and
the
place
was
packed
Saw
some
friends
I
tried
to
smile
but
my
face
was
jacked
Cut
the
casualtiesand
made
a
bee
line
for
a
bar
Surprised
I
made
it
cause
the
leash
it
only
goes
so
far

Long
Islands
in
my
system
I
feel
like
Sonny
Liston
By
the
second
round
I
was
going
to
town
and
she
was
in
her
coat
I
said
I
will
find
a
ride
tonight
but
baby
you
can
go
Right
then
I
knew
she
blew
it
I
found
her
drama
amusing
She
took
another
drink
and
must've
said
screw
it
And
she
just
turned
around
and
smiled....
And
then
she
hit
me
And
then
she
hit
me
I
know
I
drive
her
crazy
I
bring
out
her
best
and
worst
It's
not
her
fault
she
loves
me
but
It's
all
my
fault
when
she
gets
hurt
Right
I
knew
she
lost
it
She
drew
line
and
I
crossed
it
I
was
drinking
like
it's
water
from
fauset
And
I
just
turned
around
and
smiled....
And
then
she
hit
me
And
then
she
hit
me
And
then
she
hit
me
