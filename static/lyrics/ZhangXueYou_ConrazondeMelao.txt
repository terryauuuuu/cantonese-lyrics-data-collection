Emmanuel
thinks
about
the
girl
He
knows
her
all
too
well
She's
got
him
a
tangle
And
she's
got
him
in
her
spell
She
dances
with
his
mind
and
she
dances
on
the
floor
And
she
knows
how
to
drive
him
So
lo-co!(ad
lib
-
passing
chord:
so
she
goes)
chorus
by
Emmanuel
Emmanuel
knows
she's
trouble
But
what
else
can
he
do
She's
got
him
'round
his
finger
With
her
different
points
of
view
She
can
dance
away
her
troubles
She's
danced
into
his
life
She
got
him
working
hard
for
her
All
night

Emmanuel
seen
it
all
But
no
like
this
before
A
girl
who
turns
up
the
heat
By
walking
through
the
door
And
when
she
hits
the
dancing
floor
She
burns
up
all
the
lights
She's
the
one
and
only
one
thing
in
his
sight
Emmanuel
just
doesn't
know
Where
this
all
is
gonna
lead
He
only
knows
what
he
wants
And
what
he
really
needs
He
needs
to
know
What
makes
her
tick
and
all
her
other
games
He
knows
no
other
woman
Be
the
same
