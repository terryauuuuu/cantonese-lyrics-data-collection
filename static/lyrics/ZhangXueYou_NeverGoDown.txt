Alone
in
the
city
Ain't
no
streets
of
gold
Wallowing
in
self
pity
In
a
world
so
hard
and
cold
Walking
the
streets
in
vain
To
find
a
friendly
face
But
all
I
got
was
pain
And
was
lost
wthout
a
trace
Bridge
Scared
and
alone
I
didn't
have
the
strength
to
carry
on
I
thought
that
I
would
never
win
this
fight
Took
solace
in
my
loneliness
But
now
I
see
the
light
(Chorus)
Coz-I-oh
I-oh
I
I'm
never
going
down
again
I
said
I-oh
I-oh
I
I'm
never
going
down
again
I
've
danced
with
the
devil
I
have
prayed
to
the
Lord

Drowned
in
a
sea
of
sorrrow
My
joie
da
vivre
was
searching
for
salvation
from
on
high
But
hope
springs
enternal
like
true
love
And
I
made
a
vow
somewhere,
somehow
That
I
would
rise
above
(Chorus)
Coz-I-oh
I-oh
I
I'm
never
going
down
again
I
said
I-oh
I-oh
I
I'm
never
going
down
again
Looked
to
the
sky
I
was
searching
for
salvation
from
on
high
But
hope
springs
enternal
like
true
love
And
I
made
a
vow
somewhere,
somehow
That
I
would
rise
above
(Chorus)
Coz-I-oh
I-oh
I
I'm
never
going
down
again
