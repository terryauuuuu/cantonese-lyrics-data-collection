we
used
to
laugh
we
used
to
cry
we
used
to
bow
our
heads
then
wonder
why
but
now
you're
gone
i
guess
i'll
carry
on
and
make
the
best
of
what
you've
left
to
me
left
to
me
left
to
me
i
need
you
like
the
flower
needs
the
rain
you
know
i
need
you
guess
i'll
start
it
all
again
you
know
i
need
you
like
the
winter
needs
the
spring
you
know
i
need
you
i
need
you
and
every
day
i'd
laugh
the
hours
away
just
knowing
you
were
thinking
of
me
and
then
it
came
that
i
was
put
to
blame
for
every
story
told
about
me
about
me
about
me
i
need
you
like
the
flower
needs
the
rain
you
know
i
need
you
guess
i'll
start
it
all
again

it
all
again

need
you
like
the
flower
