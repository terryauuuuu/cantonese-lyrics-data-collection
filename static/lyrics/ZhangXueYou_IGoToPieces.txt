When
I
See
You
Walking
Down
The
Street
I
Get
So
Shaky
And
I
feel
So
Weak
I
Tell
My
Eyes
Look
The
Other
Way
But
They
Don't
Listen
To
A
Word
I
Say
And
I
Go
To
Pieces
And
I
Almost
Die
Evertime
My
Baby
Passes
By
I
Tell
My
Arms
To
Hold
Someone
New
Another
Love
That
Will
Be
True
But
They
Don't
Listen
They
Don't
Seem
To
Care
They
Reach
For
her
But
She's
not
there
And
I
Go
To
Pieces
And
I
Wanna
Hide
Go
To
Pieces
and
I
Almost
Die
Evertime
My
Baby
Passes
By

I
Remember
What
You
Said
When
You
Said
Goodbye
Baby
We'll
Meet
Again
Soon
Maybe
But
Until
We
Do
All
My
Best
To
You
I'm
So
Lonely
I
Think
About
You
Only
I
Go
To
Places
We
Used
To
Go
But
I
Know
You'll
Never
Show
You
Hurt
Me
So
Much
Inside
How
I
Hope
You're
Satisfide
And
I
Go
To
Pieces
And
I
Wanna
Hide
Go
To
Pieces
And
I
Almost
Die
Evertime
My
Baby
Passes
By
Go
To
Pieces
And
I,(And
Die)
Go
To
Pieces
And
I,(Wanna
Hide)
Go
To
Pieces
And
I,My
Baby
