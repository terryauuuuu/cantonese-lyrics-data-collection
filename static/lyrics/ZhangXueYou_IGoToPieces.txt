I
See
You
Walking
Down
The
StreetI
Get
So
Shaky
And
I
feel
So
WeakI
Tell
My
Eyes
Look
The
Other
WayBut
They
Don't
Listen
To
A
Word
I
SayAnd
I
Go
To
Pieces
And
I
Almost
DieEvertime
My
Baby
Passes
ByI
Tell
My
Arms
To
Hold
Someone
NewAnother
Love
That
Will
Be
TrueBut
They
Don't
ListenThey
Don't
Seem
To
CareThey
Reach
For
her
But
She's
not
thereAnd
I
Go
To
Pieces
And
I
Wanna
HideGo
To
Pieces
and
I
Almost
DieEvertime
My
Baby
Passes
ByI
Remember
What
You
SaidWhen
You
Said
Goodbye
BabyWe'll
Meet
Again
Soon
MaybeBut
Until
We
Do
All
My
Best
To
YouI'm
So
Lonely
I
Think
About
You
OnlyI
Go
To
Places
We
Used
To
GoBut
I
Know
You'll
Never
ShowYou
