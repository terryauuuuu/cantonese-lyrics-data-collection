It's
hard
to
sleep
at
night
when
you're
lonely
It's
hard
to
get
the
date
when
you're
homely
if
I
could
spit
in
my
face
Hey
please
baby
can
I
get
your
number?
Cause
losers
are
look
like
so
much
funner
She
told
me,
'Can't
we
just
be
friends?'
She
could
have
mentioned
that
before
she
let
me
in
I
shave
my
head,
I
take
a
bath
My
clothes
are
cool
but
they
still
laugh
I
don't
get
luck,
I
feel
so
lame
Boy,
do
I
got
it
made
Yea....
I
bet
you
probably
wished
you
never
met
me

But
I'd
gladly
kiss
your
brown
eyes
if
you
let
me
We
might
as
well
go
and
have
some
fun
Because
I
know
that
you're
gonna
dump
me
when
you're
done
I
ask
you
once,
I
beg
you
twice
I
don't
get
stone
and
I
don't
have
lice
You
said
it
ain't
me,
'Please
understand....'
That
you
like
him
and
you
don't
like
me
I
ask
you
out,
it
never
fails
You're
too
busy
painting
your
nails
I
feel
so
lame,
I
am
so
ashamed
Boy,
do
I
got
it
made
Yea....
It's
hard
to
sleep
at
night
when
you're
lonely
It's
hard
to
get
a
date,
me
so
homely
