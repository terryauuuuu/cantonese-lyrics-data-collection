When
you're
lost
and
the
light
is
fading
The
wind
blows
cold
and
you
can't
find
your
way
back
home
Remember
that
the
darkest
hour
is
just
before
the
dawn
Sometimes
a
leap
of
fauth
is
all
it
takes
Cause
only
love
can
see
the
path
to
set
you
free
Just
close
your
eyes,
look
inside,
and
let
your
heart
believe
There's
been
a
force
so
strong
beside
you
all
along
You'll
know
it
when
your
dream
comes
true
There's
something
only
love
can
do

In
your
quest
for
a
new
horizon
Set
your
course
find
a
star
to
light
your
way
Although
the
task
may
seen
sometimes
to
be
more
than
you
can
bear
One
thing
you
need
to
know
you
are
not
alone
If
you
believe
in
miracles
then
you
can
be
the
one
To
shine
you
light
and
show
the
world
There's
nothing
love
can't
overcome
There's
something
only
love
can
do
