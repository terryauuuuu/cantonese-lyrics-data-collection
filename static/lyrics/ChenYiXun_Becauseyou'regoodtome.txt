Because
you're
good
to
me
babe,
I
know
That
you're
up
to
something
And
I
don't
like
it
Because
you're
good
to
me
babe,
I
know
You're
no
good
It's
no
good
To
be
in
love
with
you
again
當時分手之後
多麼心痛
你卻還能夠說
都是我的錯
之後你打電話
說你很寂寞
一直想念我
是否還能夠做個朋友
(No
baby
No
baby)
請你別再靠近我
(No
baby
No
baby)
你沒那麼的保守
(No
baby
No
baby)
別到現在才來對我說
你後悔了
And
ask
me
for
more
Because
you're
good
to
me
babe,
I
know
That
you're
up
to
something
And
I
don't
like
it
Because
you're
good
to
me
babe,
I
know
You're
no
good
It's
no
good
To
be
in
love
with
you
again
昨晚跟好朋友
開個
Party
怎麼都沒想到
會再見到你
你的甜言蜜語
讓我佩服到底
誰在誰懷裏
愛誰不過是個騙局

(No
baby
No
baby)
請你別再靠近我
(No
baby
No
baby)
你沒那麼的保守
(No
baby
No
baby)
別到現在才來對我說
你後悔了
