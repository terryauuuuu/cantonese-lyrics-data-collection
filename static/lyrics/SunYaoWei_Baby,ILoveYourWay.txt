Shadows
grow
so
long
before
my
eye,
And
they're
moving
across
the
page.
Suddenly
the
day
turns
into
night,
Far
away
from
the
city.
But
don't
hesitate,
cause
your
love
won't
wait.
Ooh,
Baby
I
love
your
way.
Wanna
tell
you
I
love
your
way.
Wanna
be
with
you
night
and
day.
Moon
appears
to
shine
and
light
the
sky,
With
the
help
of
some
firefly,
Wonder
how
they
have
the
power
to
shine.
Shine,shine,shine.

I
can
see
them
under
the
pine.
But
don't
hesitate,
cause
your
love
won't
wait.
Ooh
baby
I
love
your
way.
Wanna
tell
you
I
love
your
way.
Wanna
be
with
you
night
and
day.
I
can
see
the
sunset
in
your
eyes,
Brown
and
grey,
and
blue
besides.
Clouds
are
stalking
islands
in
the
sun.
I
wish
I
could
buy
one,
out
of
season.
