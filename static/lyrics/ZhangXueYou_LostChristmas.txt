I
wish
Christmas
could
be
good
again
That
you
could
forget
everything
Just
for
one
day
I'd
take
you
right
back
To
when
you
were
a
little
girl
To
when
each
day
promised
you
pearls
Before
you
grew
up
(Bridge)
And
I
wish
that
we
owned
the
house
we
live
in

And
I
wish
that
we
had
no
bills
to
pay
And
I
wish
I
could
find
something
this
Christmas
Something
so
valuable
that
it
didn't
cost
(Chorus)
Happy
Christmas
to
you
May
all
your
dreams
come
true
And
may
somebody
save
you
tonight
And
may
you
still
believe
that
I
might
And
may
some
things
just
turn
out
all
right
