(男)When
my
work
is
through
at
the
end
of
the
day
There's
nothing
else
that
I'd
rather
do
Than
to
be
with
you
at
the
end
of
the
day
To
be
right
by
your
side
makes
me
feel
brand
new
'Cause
you're
my
girl
my
woman
my
friend
And
that's
how
it's
gonna
be
'til
the
end
Loving
you
is
what
I
lived
for
And
I
can't
ask
for
anything
more
You're
my
woman
my
girl
and
my
friend
Rolled
into
one
(女)You're
my
man
and
I'm
at
the
prime
of
my
life
To
you
I
give
myself
all
my
heart
All
of
what
I
am
at
the
prime
of
my
life
I'll
never
let
a
thing
come
to
break
us
apart
'Cause
I'm
your
girl
your
woman
your
friend
And
that's
how
it's
gonna
be
'til
the
end
Loving
you
is
what
I
lived
for
And
I
can't
ask
for
anything
more

Than
to
be
your
woman
your
girl
and
your
friend
Being
(男)with
you
my
love
Just
makes
my
day
complete
(女)Holding
you
close
my
love
Creates
a
wondrous
dream
(男)No
need
to
say
the
word
No
fancy
places
for
me
(女)Love
is
anywhere
As
long
as
you
are
there
with
me
(合)We'll
be
free
I'm
your
girl
your
woman
your
friend
And
that's
how
it's
gonna
be
'til
the
end
Loving
you
is
what
I
lived
for
And
I
can't
ask
for
anything
more
Than
to
be
your
woman
your
girl
and
your
friend
Rolled
into
one
I'm
your
girl
your
woman
your
friend
And
that's
how
it's
gonna
be
'til
the
end
Loving
you
is
what
I
lived
for
And
I
can't
ask
for
anything
more
Than
to
be
your
woman
your
girl
and
your
friend
Rolled
into
one
