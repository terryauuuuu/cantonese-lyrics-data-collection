I'm
so
young
and
you're
so
old
This
my
darling
I've
been
told
I
don't
care
just
what
they
say
'Cause
forever
I
will
pray
You
and
I
will
be
as
free
As
the
birds
up
in
the
trees
Oh
please
stay
by
me
Diana
Thrills
I
get
when
you
hold
me
close
Oh
my
darling
you're
the
most
I
love
you
but
do
you
love
me
Oh
Diana
can't
you
see
I
love
you
with
all
my
heart
I
got
hope
we'll
never
part
Oh
please
stay
by
me
Diana

Oh
my
darling
oh
my
lover
Tell
me
that
there
is
no
other
I
love
you
with
all
my
heart
Oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
don't
you
know
I
love
you
love
you
so
Only
you
can
take
my
heart
Only
you
can
tear
it
apart
When
you
hold
me
in
your
loving
arms
I
can
feel
you
giving
all
your
charms
Hold
me
darling,
hold
me
tight
Ands
squeeze
me
baby
with
all
your
might
Oh
please
stay
by
me
Diana
Oh
please
Diana
Oh
please
Diana
